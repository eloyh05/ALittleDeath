          <strong>
            <p>Vacancy was lit, the guests were checking in</p>
            <p>The concierge was cold</p>
            <p>The water pipes had mold all over them</p>
            <p>The room was fit for two</p>
            <p>The bed was left in ruins</p>
            <p>The neighbor was knocking, yeah</p>
            <p>But no one would let him in</p>
            <p>Touch me, yeah</p>
            <p>I want you to touch me there</p>
            <p>Make me feel like I am breathing</p>
            <p>Feel like I am human</p>
            <p>Dancing through the night</p>
            <p>A vodka and a sprite</p>
            <p>A glimpse of the silhouettes</p>
            <p>A night that they never forget</p>
                        <p>Touch me, yeah</p>
            <p>I want you to touch me there</p>
            <p>Make me feel like I am breathing</p>
            <p>Feel like I am human</p>
                        <p>Touch me, yeah</p>
            <p>I want you to touch me there</p>
            <p>Make me feel like I am breathing</p>
            <p>Feel like I am human</p>
            <p>She sought death on a queen-sized bed</p>
            <p>And he had said, "Darling, your looks can kill,</p> 
            <p>So now you're dead."</p>
                                    <p>Touch me, yeah</p>
            <p>I want you to touch me there</p>
            <p>Make me feel like I am breathing</p>
            <p>Feel like I am human</p>
                                    <p>Touch me, yeah</p>
            <p>I want you to touch me there</p>
            <p>Make me feel like I am breathing</p>
            <p>Feel like I am human</p>
